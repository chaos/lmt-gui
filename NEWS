=========================================================================

* Repackage for release as companion package of lmt-3.0

* ltop removed as it has been replaced with C/curses ltop in lmt package

* Better automake integration, rewritten jar script

* Build with older gnu java on chaos4 for maximum compatibility.

* Install lmt jar file in standard system location

* Deprecate system-wide lmtrc file, and use only user-supplied ~/.lmtrc.
  See example in doc directory.  Note that  main lmt package no longer
  uses lmtrc file - it has a new config file: /etc/lmt/lmt.conf.
